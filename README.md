Timelapse That Folder!

Reviewing large time lapse file sets is bad in Explorer and time consuming to setup in After Effects.

Timelapse That Folder quickly cycles through all images in a folder, displaying them sequantially as quickly as disc allows.

Forward and reverse viewing are supported.

Indivual images can be copied as:
1.  File path
2.  Image data (for pasting into Photoshop for example)
3.  Image file
